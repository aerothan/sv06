# Easy Printed Mods

Make sure to give a like to the designers and post your make.

See [list of filaments](/Parts/printable-parts/#sovol-colored-filament) that are close to SV06's color.

## Cable strain relief

This is a **MUST HAVE**. They install under the existing heated bed cable strain relief with a zip tie or two.

## Heated bed cable support

This is a **MUST HAVE**. This mod keeps the heated bed cable from dragging on the work surface and rubbing on the plastic cover of the frame.

## Back mounted stock part cooling fan

This small modification makes it easy to relocate the stock cooling fan to the back of the X-Carriage and provides better viewing of the hot end from the front.

## Extruder Hand-Winder

## Cable Chain

This cable chain (spine) supports the extruder ribbon cable and stops it from sagging on taller prints. Works on SV06 Plus but you'll need to print more links.
